K-Means Clustering Algortihm with Weight

## General description
 
This code is a Python implementation of k-means clustering algorithm.

## Input

numpy array X of shape(n_samples, n_features)

optional: numpy array W of shape(n_samples,) as weight. E.x., weight[i] = 2 has the effect that data[i] appears 2 times.

## Output

The clusters of points.

## Usage example

- plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.ipynb
- test_kmeans_lzx.py
